  <div>  
    <h4 class="text-2xl">What is this?</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">A private space online to capture thoughts, ideas, and anything in between. It has the privacy of a journal, but is meant for short tweet-like bites of text. It's not a social network -- your thoughts here are totally yours.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 class="text-2xl">How did it come about?</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">Read <a class="underline" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/thespoonful/p/private-thinking-nooks?r=2brp10&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scribble's story</a> to learn more about the motivation and journey behind it.</p>
  </div>
  <div>  
    <h4 class="text-2xl">Is there a mobile app?</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">Scribble is a website (for now). It's optimized for your browser on mobile too, though. You can bookmark it on your phone for easy access.</p>
  </div>
  <div>  
    <h4 class="text-2xl">Is it free?</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">You bet. I consider this little app to be a gift, and I want anyone who likes it to use it.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 class="text-2xl">Will it always be free?</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">That's my intention! I may consider charging a small one-time download fee for a mobile app to offset server maintenence. No mobile development has started yet though!</p>
  </div>
  <div>  
    <h4 class="text-2xl">Can I upload images?</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">Scribbles are intentionally text-only. Freedom comes from constraints.</p>
  </div>
  <div>  
    <h4 class="text-2xl">Who builds this?</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">ðŸ‘‹ I'm <a class="underline" href="https://saaliklok.com">Saalik</a>, a builder, writer, and scribbler.
